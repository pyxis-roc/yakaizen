Ether
    A medium for exchanging messages

Channels
    An addressing mechanism: prod, debug

Routers
    Agents use Routers to obtain messages from the Ether
    Routers may use various criteria to forward messages to agents based on agent id, sender id, some sort of aggregation, etc.

Agents
    Senders and consumers of messages, place messages onto channels, and read from channels.

WorkflowAgent
    Produces inputs and waits for outputs, aka interacts with the world.
    Determines the beginning and end of traces.

Postings
    Long-lived Data independent of any message
    Used to maintain global state or agent's local state

AsyncMessage
    Opaque, asynchronous delivery

    One-to-Many, with no notion of replies

    Has Sources [other messages], and Attachments

    A message is active if there is no message that marks it as a source, and it is not a TerminatingMessage.

    Messages can have an expiry time.


Attachments

    Blobs
    ResourceConstraints
    ResourceConsumption
    Directory

 Read -> can return a RouterShutdown message which requires the agent to re-acquire the router.

Trace
    A DAG of messages, though unsure which message will have multiple sources.

    Traces are active/inactive.  Messages in inactive traces are not readable.

    Traces can be re-done
